### 1. [使用油猴脚本为网页添加自己的快捷键](https://wcedmisten.fyi/post/keyboard-shortcuts-userscripts/)

根据作者的网页，我自己简单写了下，还挺好玩，代码：

```JavaScript
// ==UserScript==
// @name         测试一下
// @namespace    http://tampermonkey.net/
// @version      2024-05-26
// @description  try to take over the world!
// @author       You
// @match        *://github.com*
// @match        *://github.com/*
// @match        *://www.accessdata.fda.gov/*
// @icon         https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?sz=64&domain=wcedmisten.fyi
// @grant        none
// @require      https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@violentmonkey/shortcut@1
// ==/UserScript==

(function() {
    'use strict';
    VM.shortcut.register('ctrl-alt-n', () => {
        location.href = 'https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfPMN/pmn.cfm';
    });
    VM.shortcut.register('ctrl-alt-s', () => {
        const input = document.getElementById("DeviceName");
        input.focus();
    });
    VM.shortcut.register('ctrl-shift-c', () => {
        if (location.href.includes("?ID=")) {
            // copy the ID from the details page
            var xpath = '/html/body/div[3]/maxamineignore/div[2]/div[2]/span[2]/table[2]/tbody/tr/td/table/tbody/tr[2]/td/table/tbody/tr/td/table/tbody/tr[2]/td';
            var deviceId = document.evaluate(
                    xpath,
                    document,
                    null,
                    XPathResult.FIRST_ORDERED_NODE_TYPE,
                    null
                )
                .singleNodeValue.innerText;

            window.navigator.clipboard.writeText(deviceId);
        } else {
            // copy the last result from the table
            xpath = '/html/body/div[3]/maxamineignore/div[2]/div[2]/span[2]/table[2]/tbody/tr/td/table/tbody';
            var table = document.evaluate(
                    xpath,
                    document,
                    null,
                    XPathResult.FIRST_ORDERED_NODE_TYPE,
                    null
                )
                .singleNodeValue;

            var tableLength = table.children.length;
            var lastRow = table.children[tableLength - 1]

            // get the ID from the last element
            deviceId = lastRow.children[2].firstChild.text;

            window.navigator.clipboard.writeText(deviceId);
        }
    });
})();
```

下面是使用的效果：

1. `ctrl-alt-n` 打开网页
2. `ctrl-alt-s` 聚焦设备输入
3. 输入关键词，回车拿到搜索结果
4. `ctrl-shift-c` 复制最后一个设备号
5. `ctrl-v` 验证一下是否复制成功

### 1. [学会有选择性地忽略（Ignore Selectively）](https://medium.com/illumination/the-7-surprising-yet-inspiring-habits-of-highly-effective-leaders-0155dcfba6ea)

这篇文章作者讨论了高效领导者的 7 个的习惯，我从其中挑选了一个作为本期的主题，因为这个跟我一直在说的一句话很类似：选择比努力更重要。

- Embrace Failure. Highly effective leaders celebrate failure as a valuable learning experience. They see failure as a necessary stepping stone to success.
- Be Authentic. Highly effective leaders are unapologetically themselves. They lead with authenticity, openly sharing their values, beliefs, and vulnerabilities.
- Ignore Selectively. Highly effective leaders are masters at selective ignorance, which helps them to drive productivity and efficiency in their organizations.
- Embrace Imperfection. Highly effective leaders embrace imperfection, and they are obsessed with innovation through rapid experimentation and adaptation.
- Be Transparent. Highly effective leaders believe in transparency as a cornerstone of trust and accountability.
- Cultivate Empathy. Highly effective leaders foster a culture of empathy and gratitude with their organizations, while not neglecting their own well-being.
- Embrace Change. Highly effective leaders embrace change, and continue to evolve their organizations to stay relevant and competitive.

> Effective leaders understand how to distinguish the signal from the noise, and the importance of selective ignorance.

> They weight the urgent vs the important, and commit their time to tasks that will yield the highest and most meaningful results. They keep their teams focused, and actively remove distractions and cut out things that are not strategically important.
