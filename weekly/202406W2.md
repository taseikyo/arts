### 1. [如果你能正确回答这 7 个问题，你就很擅长 Python](https://zlliu.medium.com/youre-decent-at-python-if-you-can-answer-these-7-questions-correctly-7de5e8279e7f)

1、`@print`

```Python
@print
def testing():
    print('hello!!')
    return 1000
```

What does this do?

```Markdown
A) Syntax error. There is no such thing as @ in Python
B) this causes testing() to automatically print 1000 when we call it
C) this prints <function testing at 0x1023e2340>
D) this prints 1000 automatically without us calling testing()
E) testing()'s metadata will automatically print whenever it is called
```

<details>
    <summary>Answer</summary>
Answer: C

here, we are decorating testing() with print(). This is the same as:

```Python
def testing():
    print('hello!!')
    return 1000

testing = print(testing)
```

since print(testing) is called, <function testing at 0x1023e2340> will be printed (the gibberish numbers at the end might differ tho)
</details>

2、`*_`

```Python
a, b, *_ = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(_)
```

What does this print?

```
A) Syntax error
B) [3, 4, 5]
C) [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
D) <generator object <genexpr> at 0x1003847c0>
E) NameError: ‘_’ is not a valid variable name
```

<details>
    <summary>Answer</summary>
Answer: B

- `_` is a valid variable name
- `a` is assigned to 1 and `b` is assigned to 2 (tuple unpacking)
- `*` in front of `_` allows `_` to "catch" multiple values (0 to infinite)
- `_` will thus "catch" all unassigned numbers — 3, 4, 5
- `_` will thus be `[3, 4, 5]`
</details>

3、more than 1 `*_`

```Python
*__, a, b, *_ = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
print(__, _)
```

What does this print?

```
A) Syntax error
B) [1] [4, 5, 6]
C) [1, 2] [5, 6]
D) [1, 2, 3] [6]
E) <generator object <genexpr> at 0x1003847c0>
```

<details>
    <summary>Answer</summary>
Answer: A

Only ONE `*` is allowed per expression. Having 2 causes a SyntaxError
</details>

4、class shenanigans

```Python
class Dog:
  def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
    args, kwargs = kwargs, args
    self.name = args['name']
    self.age = kwargs[0]

dog = Dog('rocky', 5)
```

What error does this cause?

```
A) No error
B) ZeroDivisionError
C) IndexError
D) KeyError
E) All of the above
```

<details>
    <summary>Answer</summary>
Answer: D

`*args` allows our function to take in any number of positional arguments, while `**kwargs` allow our function to take in any number of keyword arguments.

`Dog('rocky', 5)` passes 2 positional arguments to `__init__`, and thus `args=('rocky', 5)` while `kwargs={}` (no keyword arguments here)

`args, kwargs = kwargs, args` switches args and kwargs. So now, `args={}` and `kwargs=('rocky', 5)`

When we attempt to call `args['name']`, we get a KeyError as at this point, args is an empty dictionary.
</details>

5、GIL

What is the Python Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)?

```
A) a physical lock that secures Python servers from intruders
B) a thing that prevents the Python interpreter from leaking data to other processes on your computer
C) a programming paradigm that allows us to run multiple Python processes concurrently
D) a thing that allows one thread to run per interpreter at one time
E) a thing that enables our Python interpreter to run code faster
```

<details>
    <summary>Answer</summary>
Answer: D

The Python GIL makes is such that only 1 thread is able to run in the Python interpreter at one time. (tho we can use multiprocessing to circumvent this)
</details>

6、True = False

```Python
True = False
False = True

print(not True, not False)
```

what does this print?

```
A) SyntaxError
B) False True
C) True False
D) True True
E) False False
```

<details>
    <summary>Answer</summary>
Answer: A

We cannot assign anything to True as True is a reserved Python keyword. I hope you answered this correctly.
</details>

7、Context manager

What is a context manager used for?

```
A) to manage contexts
B) to properly handle resources eg file operations or databases
C) to ensure that type hints in Python are enforced
D) to make sure that any exceptions do not affect other contexts
E) to ensure that the Python interpreter does not taking up an excessive amount of RAM
```

<details>
    <summary>Answer</summary>
Answer: B

```Python
# let's say we need to read a file

file = open('hi.txt')

print(file.read())

file.close()
```

if we do this, there’s a chance that `file.close()` might not executed due to some error. Not closing the file might lead to the following problems:

- the file might take up RAM and slow down your program
- changes made to the file might not stick, as many files only save properly when they are closed
- in Windows, a file is treated as locked when it is open, so other scanners or programs might not be able to read it
- and other weird issues

```Python
# reading file using context manager

with open('hi.txt') as file:
    print(file.read())
```
